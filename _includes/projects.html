                    <span class="project-title"><a href="#" target="_blank"> Supervised Deep Learning Framework for Proactive Anomaly Detection in Cloud</a></span> <span class="project-tagline"><p>A two stage novel model was built where in 1st stage, hybrid of long short term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) is used to predict future resource usage. In 2nd stage, LSTM classification model was build to classify expected state as normal or abnormal.</p>
<p>Technologies used: Keras, Python, Docker</p></span>

                    <span class="project-title"><a href="#" target="_blank"> On the Fly Encryptor</a></span> <span class="project-tagline"><p>Each data block is encrypted and stored on write() and decrypted on read(). Kernel read() and write() functions were modified for this purpose. Encryptor was tested on ciphers where size of encrypted data may differ from that of plaintext.</p>

Database was tested on exact search queries, range queries, index queries, etc. Indexing was done on the database to enhance query performance.</p>
<p>Technologies used: MariaDb, Galera cluster</p></span>

                    <span class="project-title"><a href="#" target="_blank">Increasing Seatbelt Awareness among Himachali drivers</a></span> <span class="project-tagline"><p>This was a social as well as technical project. 
Several surveys were conducted to identify root cause of lack of seat belt awareness. Built a prototype which can track whether passengers in car are wearing seat belts. The seat belt usage data is futher sent over cloud. The data on cloud can be accessed by governing agencies to track seat belt usage.</p>
<p>Technologies used: IR sensors, GSM modeule, accelerometer, MySQL</p></span>

                    <span class="project-title"><a href="#hook">Hand Gesture Replication Robotic Arm</a></span> <p>Arduino controlled robotic arm to replicate the human hand. Motion sensors like accelerometers, gyro sensors and flex sensors were used to take signals from the human hand. XBee modules were used for wireless communication. Uses Prediction and Correction algorithm for precise replication. GUI using visual studio was built as an alternative to send signals to the robotic arm.</p>
